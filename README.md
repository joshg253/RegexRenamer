## Objective
> [!NOTE]
> This repo was initially seeded using https://sourceforge.net/projects/regexrenamer/files/RegexRenamer/1.3.1/RegexRenamer_Source_v1.3.1.zip

Thanks to [xiperware](https://sourceforge.net/u/xiperware/profile/) for this fantastic tool, originally hosted [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regexrenamer/).

However, the project has been dormant since 2014 so I created this repo to update RegexRenamer to current frameworks, fix bugs, and potentially extend RegexRenamer.

Initially, I'll attempt to clone all the original documentation, etc., and then update it as necessary.
